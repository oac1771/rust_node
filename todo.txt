This product could be a like cluster where each pins each others data to as backups for each other
    - look into if you can leverage zksync network to manage communication between nodes
    - smart contract deployed here that is basically a smart wallet that emits events when storing ipfs
        data. It basically stores ipfs hashes


ipfs api docs
http://docs.ipfs.tech.ipns.localhost:8080/reference/kubo/rpc/#getting-started
http://ipfscluster.io.ipns.localhost:8080/documentation/reference/api/
http://docs.ipfs.tech.ipns.localhost:8080/reference/kubo/rpc/#api-v0-bitswap-ledger

example: curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/v0/id

helpful ipfs commands:
ipfs repo gc
    - initiate garbage collection
ipfs pin ls 
    - list pinned files
curl -X POST -d '{"meta_data": "info", "data": {"foo": "hi"}}' http://localhost:8000/add/todo.txt


Rough plan:

create helm chart for deploying to k8s
    - use alpine base image for node
    - for ipfs: https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/kubo/
    - can use k9s as a nice way to visualize stuff

set up smart contract deployed to local instance of chain
containerize into docker compose
have containerized node talk to smart contract
