Rough plan:

make postgress statefulset
add helm tests for geth, postgress, zksync 

remember to switch imagepulPolicy of geth zksync and postress to ifNotPresent from Never


set up smart contract deployed to local instance of chain
    - deploy geth
    - zksync
    - postgress

have containerized node talk to smart contract 

refactor ideas:
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder
