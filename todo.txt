Rough plan:

make postgress statefulset
add helm tests for geth, postgress, zksync 
set up smart contract deployed to local instance of chain
    - deploy geth
    - zksync
    - postgress

have containerized node talk to smart contract 

refactor ideas:
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder
