Rough plan: 

continue to do general refactor
    - look at services and do error handling there. get rid of unwraps
    - make authentication error enum thing do this trait impl to be able to use ? operation https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html
mint session token NFT on authentication
track gascost in zksync client


refactor ideas:
    - make remove identity publish empty data to ipfs network at same content identifier so its effectively deleted
    - dont use hardhat and just use rust ethers 
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder
    - look into axum instead or rocket
