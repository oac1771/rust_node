Rough plan: 

add test_identity.rs
config.rs has unwraps :(
data in models.rs has unwrap :(


continue to do general refactor
    - look at services and do error handling there. get rid of unwraps
    - make authentication error enum thing do this trait impl to be able to use ? operation https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html
    - tests for controllers
create integration test
    - deploy contract
    - register
    - authenticate

mint session token NFT on authentication

track gascost in zksync client
    - maybe when you instantiate zksync client you create empty gas tracker
        so per reqwest 



refactor ideas:
    - make remove identity publish empty data to ipfs network at same content identifier so its effectively deleted
    - dont use hardhat and just use rust ethers 
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder
    - look into axum instead or rocket
