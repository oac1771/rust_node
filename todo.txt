Rough plan:

switch to use colima
create docker image for helm test and use that instead
    - install jq and other tools to test helm deployments

remember to switch imagepulPolicy of geth zksync and postress to ifNotPresent from Never
figure out which ports mean what for geth

add helm tests for geth, postgress, zksync 
set up smart contract deployed to local instance of chain
    - deploy geth
    - zksync
    - postgress

have containerized node talk to smart contract 

refactor ideas:
    - increase minikube allocation?
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?)
