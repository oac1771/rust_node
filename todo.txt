Rough plan: 

think about using anyhow context for better error messages?
move over to axum
start looking into p2p for state management

mint session token NFT on authentication

track gascost in zksync client
    - maybe when you instantiate zksync client you create empty gas tracker
        so per reqwest 


refactor ideas:
    - ethers-rs being deprecated: https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/issues/2667
    - make remove identity publish empty data to ipfs network at same content identifier so its effectively deleted
    - dont use hardhat and just use rust ethers 
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder
    - look into axum instead or rocket
