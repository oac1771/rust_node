Rough plan:

track gascost in zksync client
add tests for services and clients
make authentication controller more robust to not break out of thread
mint session token NFT on authentication


make contract emit specific registration event to get token id instead of looking at transfer

refactor ideas:
    - make remove identity publish empty data to ipfs network at same content identifier so its effectively deleted
    - dont use hardhat and just use rust ethers 
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder

Questions:
    - how are pvc and pv linked?
    - volumeMount meaning in statefulset
