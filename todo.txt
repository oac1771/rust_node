Rough plan:

add helm test for zksync
add init container for node to wait for ipfs and zksync to be ready
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49368047/what-is-the-equivalent-for-depends-on-in-kubernetes

set up smart contract deployed to local instance of chain

have containerized node talk to smart contract
    - listen to events

encrypt ipfs address and data hash
    - before storing ipfs file, add hash of data as field
    - push encrypted ipfs address and data hash to smart contract
        - form -> {ipfs_address}:{data_hash}
    - on validation, publish event with ipfs_address and data_hash
    - node reads that event, gets data from ipfs, validates data hash
        and decides if request is valid or not

refactor ideas:
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder

Questions:
    - how are pvc and pv linked?
    - volumeMount meaning in statefulset
