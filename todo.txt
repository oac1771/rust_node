Rough plan: 

create integration test
    - register
    - authenticate

files that are a mess:
    config.rs
    state.rs
    data in models.rs (has unwrap)

mint session token NFT on authentication

track gascost in zksync client
    - maybe when you instantiate zksync client you create empty gas tracker
        so per reqwest 


refactor ideas:
    - ethers-rs being deprecated: https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/issues/2667
    - make remove identity publish empty data to ipfs network at same content identifier so its effectively deleted
    - dont use hardhat and just use rust ethers 
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder
    - look into axum instead or rocket
