Rough plan:

encrypt ipfs address and data hash
    - push encrypted ipfs address and data hash to smart contract
        - form -> {ipfs_address}:{data_hash}?
    - on validation, publish event with ipfs_address and data_hash
    - node reads that event, gets data from ipfs, validates data hash
        and decides if request is valid or not

make contract emit specific registration event to get token id instead of looking at transfer
track gascost in zksync client

refactor ideas:
    - make remove identity publish empty data to ipfs network at same content identifier so its efectivel deleted
    - dont use hardhat and just use rust ethers 
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder

Questions:
    - how are pvc and pv linked?
    - volumeMount meaning in statefulset
