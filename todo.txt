Rough plan:

make readme

clean up main.rs file

mint session token NFT on authentication

track gascost in zksync client
make authentication controller more robust to not break out of thread

refactor ideas:
    - make remove identity publish empty data to ipfs network at same content identifier so its effectively deleted
    - dont use hardhat and just use rust ethers 
    - make responses from main.rs return error codes in terminal (echo $?) 
        - https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/responses/#responder

Questions:
    - how are pvc and pv linked?
    - volumeMount meaning in statefulset
